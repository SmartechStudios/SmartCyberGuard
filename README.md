# **üõ°Ô∏è Smart Cyber Guard: The LLaMa-Powered AI Co-Pilot for Cyber Operations**

Smart Cyber Guard is an advanced cybersecurity agent that acts as a **force multiplier** for security teams, utilizing the **LLaMa 3.3 70B** model to automate threat analysis, investigation, and command execution in a safe, Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) environment.

Developed to address the critical **cybersecurity skills gap**, Smart Cyber Guard enables organizations to achieve faster response times, reduce human error, and gain expert-level efficiency without relying solely on scarce senior talent.

## **üí° Problem Solved**

The security industry faces an exponential growth in complex, AI-driven threats (e.g., deepfakes, sophisticated malware) combined with a severe shortage of experienced analysts. This leads to slow incident response, high risk of human error, and skilled staff being burned out by repetitive tasks.

## **‚≠ê Key Features & Value Proposition**

* **LLaMa-Powered Intelligence:** Uses LLaMa 3.3 70B as the core reasoning engine to synthesize complex security context from disparate data (logs, alerts, network outputs).  
* **Multi-Modus Operation:** Easily configured to adopt specialized security personas:  
  * **Blue Team:** Real-time incident triage, containment, and recovery commands.  
  * **Red Team:** Automated vulnerability reconnaissance and command generation.  
  * **Bug Bounty Hunting:** Efficient targeting and initial analysis of exploit paths.  
* **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Safety:** AI suggests precise, executable one-line commands, but the human analyst must explicitly approve execution, guaranteeing control and accountability.  
* **Secure On-Premise Deployment:** Built around the open-source LLaMa model to support deployment on private infrastructure, ensuring maximum **data privacy** and sovereignty.  
* **Real-Time SIEM Integration:** Seamless connection with platforms like **Wazuh** (via webhook/API) to trigger immediate, automated investigations upon alert reception.  
* **Audit-Ready Documentation:** Automatically logs every step, command, and result, producing instant, comprehensive reports for compliance and auditing purposes.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack**

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AI/ML** | LLaMa 3.3 70B | Core Reasoning Engine and Contextual Analysis |
| **Backend/API** | Python 3.x, FastAPI | Logic, API endpoints, and LLaMa model interaction |
| **Frontend/UI** | React, Tailwind CSS | Intuitive dashboard for HITL control and visualization |
| **Remote Execution** | Paramiko | Secure command execution on target servers (SSH) |
| **Integration** | Wazuh SIEM | Real-time security alert ingestion and trigger mechanism |

## **üöÄ Getting Started (High-Level Setup)**

1. **Environment Setup:** Clone the repository and configure the Python environment (Python 3.x).  
2. **LLaMa Deployment:** Deploy the LLaMa 3.3 70B model endpoint (locally or via private VPS/GPU resource).  
3. **Backend Configuration:** Update the config.py with the LLaMa API endpoint and initial target configurations.  
4. **Integration Hook:** Configure the **Wazuh** manager to send high-severity alerts to the Smart Cyber Guard webhook endpoint.  
5. **Launch:** Start the FastAPI server and the React frontend. Begin manual testing or wait for a SIEM trigger to initiate the first AI-driven investigation.
